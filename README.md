## Routes and Functionalities

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Health (`/health`)

- Route solely for ensuring the application is up and running.
- **GET** `/health`: Returns the message `"I'm okay!"` with the status code `200 OK`.

### üë§ Users (`/users`)

- The application allows users to create accounts and use them to access other functionalities.

#### Account Creation

- Users must provide a valid email and password to create an account.
- If the email is already in use, the application will not allow the account creation (`409 Conflict`).
- Passwords must meet security criteria, including at least 10 characters, 1 number, 1 lowercase letter, 1 uppercase letter, and 1 special character (`400 Bad Request`).
- Passwords are stored securely in the database using the [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) library.

#### Account Access

- Users must use the registered email and password to access their accounts.
- If incompatible data is provided, the application will respond with `401 Unauthorized`.
- After a successful login, users will receive a JWT token for future authentication.
- **This token must be sent in all requests to identify the user.**

### üîë Credentials (`/credentials`)

- Credentials refer to login information for websites and services.

#### Credential Creation

- To register a new credential, the user must provide a URL, a username, and a password.
- The user must also provide a title/name/label for the credential since it is possible to register multiple credentials for the same site.
- If none of the data is sent, the application will respond with `400 Bad Request`.
- Each credential must have a unique title/name/label. Attempts to create two credentials with the same name will be prevented (`409 Conflict`).
- Credential passwords are encrypted in the database using an application secret, with the use of the [cryptr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cryptr) library.

#### Credential Retrieval

- The application allows users to retrieve all credentials on the `/credentials` route or a specific credential using its ID on the `/credentials/{id}` route.
- If a user tries to access a credential that does not belong to them, the application will respond with `403 Forbidden`.
- If an invalid ID is sent, the response will be `400 Bad Request`.
- If the ID does not exist, the response will be `404 Not Found`.
- All returned credentials appear with the password decrypted (`200 OK`).

#### Delete Credentials

- The application allows the deletion of credentials based on their ID.
- If an invalid ID is sent, the response will be `400 Bad Request`.
- If the ID does not exist, the response will be `404 Not Found`.
- If the credential belongs to another user, the response will be `403 Forbidden`.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Secure Notes (`/notes`)

- Secure Notes are text-based information.

#### Secure Note Creation

- To register a new secure note, the user must provide a title/name/label and the content of the note.
- If none of the data is sent, the application will respond with `400 Bad Request`.
- Each note must have a unique title. Attempts to create two notes with the same name will be prevented (`409 Conflict`).

#### Secure Note Retrieval

- The application allows users to retrieve all secure notes on the `/notes` route or a specific secure note using its ID on the `/notes/{id}` route.
- If a user tries to access a note that does not belong to them, the application will respond with `403 Forbidden`.
- If an invalid ID is sent, the response will be `400 Bad Request`.
- If the ID does not exist, the response will be `404 Not Found`.

#### Delete Secure Notes

- The application allows the deletion of secure notes based on their ID.
- If an invalid ID is sent, the response will be `400 Bad Request`.
- If the ID does not exist, the response will be `404 Not Found`.
- If the note belongs to another user, the response will be `403 Forbidden`.

### üí≥ Cards (`/cards`)

- Cards represent credit and/or debit cards.

#### Card Creation

- To register a new card, the user must provide the card number, printed name, security code, expiration date, password, whether it is virtual, and its type (credit, debit, or both).
- If none of the data is sent, the application will respond with `400 Bad Request`.
- Each card must have a unique title/name/label. Attempts to create two cards with the same name will be prevented (`409 Conflict`).
- The card's security code and password are encrypted using an application secret, with the use of the [cryptr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cryptr) library.

#### Card Retrieval

- The application allows users to retrieve all their cards on the `/cards` route or a specific card using its ID on the `/cards/{id}` route.
- If a user tries to access

 a card that does not belong to them, the application will respond with `403 Forbidden`.
- If the card does not exist, the response will be `404 Not Found`.

#### Delete Cards

- The application allows the deletion of cards based on their ID.
- If an invalid ID is sent, the response will be `400 Bad Request`.
- If the ID does not exist, the response will be `404 Not Found`.
- If the card belongs to another user, the response will be `403 Forbidden`.

### üóëÔ∏è Delete Account and All User Data (`/erase`)

- The route allows the user to delete their account and all associated data.
- When this action occurs, credential, note, card, and other data are deleted from the database, along with the user's registration.
- Since it is a destructive action, the password must be sent again in the request body for the action to be executed. If the password is incorrect, the response will be `401 Unauthorized`.
